# Bitly Sublime Plugin

Started off with using code from [this demo](http://bit.ly/HdTSyK)

## Todos

* Add in preferences, to set API Key for Bit.ly API
* Add in contextual menu, so you can choose 1 URL to shorten

## Issues

* Looks like it is losing the final character of a region when it replaces links with shortened links.
